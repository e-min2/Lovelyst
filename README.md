## Inspiration

More than 6 in every 10 women feel negatively about their bodies. (Source: UK Parliament)

Women had higher rates of lifetime diagnosis for each of the anxiety disorders examined in a study. (Source: National Center for PTSD)

7 in 10 girls believe they are not good enough or do not measure up in some way. (Source: Dove SelfEsteem Fund)

After learning about these statistics, we wanted to create a project that focused on supporting women in areas such as body image issues, coping with anxiety, thinking positively, and more. According to a study done by Stanford University, words of affirmation “can produce wide-ranging benefits, including stress-buffering effects (Washington Post).” 

In addition to this, we implemented a to-do list to help women keep track of their goals while being supported by affirmations. Checklists are often helpful when there are many things to accomplish and alleviate the stress of remembering each task.

Lovelyst is a place where women can remember that they are beautiful, successful, and joyful, with the added bonus of productivity.

## What it does

Lovelyst is a widget that acts as both a calendar and mental health tool. The user can select up to 5 different categories of affirmations, and the widget will display words of affirmation based on the chosen categories. More words of affirmation can be shown by clicking the “New Affirmation” button. Another feature is creating a to-do list based on input from the user. The user can manually add their tasks to the to-do list through our add task button. Users can also delete tasks from their to-do list once they have completed that task. Lastly, the user may clear their entire to-do list by clicking on the “Clear” button.

## How we built it

We used PyQt6 for the GUI and Python for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenge we ran into was that we had never worked with PyQt6, so we had to learn everything from scratch. Furthermore, our team has very little experience with front-end development so it made it more difficult to create the GUI. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Even with our team’s lack of PyQt6 knowledge, we were able to create a product that met our expectations for this project. 

## What we learned

We learned how to utilize PyQt6 for front-end development. 

## What's next for Lovelyst

The next steps for Lovelyst would be to make the widget more visually appealing and to implement this widget into a website to make it more accessible for users. We would also like to add more categories of affirmations and more affirmations to each category.
